the molbio.aiTo locate the E. coli sample, we need to determine the labware and well it is stored in. Without this information, I cannot provide the exact code. However, I can provide a general code template to help you locate the sample:

```python
# Assuming the E. coli sample is stored in a 96 well plate
# Define the labware for the 96 well plate
plate = labware.load('96-flat', '1')

# Define the well where the E. coli sample is located
sample_well = 'E2'

# Move to the specified well
pipette.move_to(plate[sample_well])
```

Please replace `'96-flat'` with the appropriate labware name for the 96 well plate in your setup. Also, replace `'E2'` with the actual well position where the E. coli sample is stored.
