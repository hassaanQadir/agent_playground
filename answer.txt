To inoculate a flask of Luria-Bertani (LB) broth with E. coli and grow the cells overnight at 37°C with shaking, you can use the following code:

```python
# Assuming the flask is in slot 1 and the E. coli culture is in well A1 of a 96-well plate in slot 2

# Define the labware and pipette
flask = containers.load('flask', '1')
plate = containers.load('96-PCR-flat', '2')
pipette = instruments.P300_Single()

# Transfer 1 mL of LB broth to the flask
pipette.transfer(1000, plate['A1'], flask, new_tip='always')

# Inoculate the flask with E. coli
pipette.transfer(10, plate['A1'], flask, new_tip='always')

# Incubate the flask overnight at 37°C with shaking
# You may need to use a shaking module or an incubator with shaking capabilities
# The specific code for this step will depend on the equipment you are using

# Print the commands in the protocol
print(protocol.commands())
```

Please note that this code is a general example and may need modification based on your specific labware and deck configuration. Additionally, the code for incubation will depend on the equipment you are using for shaking and temperature control.
