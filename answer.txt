To complete the task of transferring 1 ng of DNA stored at 50 μg/ml into an Eppendorf tube with 100 μL of water, you can use the following code:

```python
# Assuming the DNA is stored in well A1 of a 96-well plate in slot 1
# Assuming the Eppendorf tube is in slot 2

# Define the labware and pipette
plate = containers.load('96-PCR-flat', '1')
eppendorf = containers.load('tube-rack-2ml', '2')
pipette = instruments.P300_Single()

# Transfer 1 ng of DNA to the Eppendorf tube
pipette.transfer(1, plate['A1'], eppendorf['A1'], new_tip='always')

# Add 100 μL of water to the Eppendorf tube
pipette.transfer(100, eppendorf['A1'], eppendorf['A1'], new_tip='always')

# Print the commands in the protocol
print(protocol.commands())
```

Please note that this code is a general example and may need modification based on your specific labware and deck configuration.
