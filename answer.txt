To put 1 ng of DNA stored at 50 ug/ml into an Eppendorf with 100 ul of water, you can use the following code:

```python
# Assuming your DNA sample is stored in a well named 'A1' in labware '1'
# Assuming your water is stored in a well named 'A2' in labware '2'
# Assuming you have a pipette defined as 'pipette' and calibrated

# Pick up a tip
pipette.pick_up_tip()

# Aspirate 1 ng of DNA from well A1 in labware '1'
pipette.aspirate(1, labware['1']['A1'])

# Dispense the DNA into the Eppendorf well
pipette.dispense(1, labware['3']['A1'])

# Aspirate 100 ul of water from well A2 in labware '2'
pipette.aspirate(100, labware['2']['A2'])

# Dispense the water into the Eppendorf well
pipette.dispense(100, labware['3']['A1'])

# Drop the tip
pipette.drop_tip()
```

Please note that you would need to replace `'1'`, `'2'`, and `'3'` with the actual labware and well names in your setup. Additionally, ensure that you have defined and calibrated your pipette.
